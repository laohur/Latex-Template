\section{Length of Submission}
\label{sec:length}

The conference accepts submissions of long papers and short papers.
Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content plus unlimited pages for references.
Upon acceptance, final versions of long papers will be given one additional page -- up to nine (9) pages of content plus unlimited pages for references -- so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.
Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references.
Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) pages in the proceedings and unlimited pages for references. 
For both long and short papers, all illustrations and tables that are part of the main text must be accommodated within these page limits, observing the formatting instructions given in the present document.
Papers that do not conform to the specified length and formatting requirements are subject to be rejected without review.

The conference encourages the submission of additional material that is relevant to the reviewers but not an integral part of the paper.
There are two such types of material: appendices, which can be read, and non-readable supplementary materials, often data or code.
Additional material must be submitted as separate files, and must adhere to the same anonymity guidelines as the main paper.
The paper must be self-contained: it is optional for reviewers to look at the supplementary material.
Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents, code or data resources that are not available to the reviewers.
Refer to Appendices~\ref{sec:appendix} and \ref{sec:supplemental} for further information. 

Workshop chairs may have different rules for allowed length and whether supplemental material is welcome.
As always, the respective call for papers is the authoritative source.


\section{Anonymity}
As reviewing will be double-blind, papers submitted for review should not include any author information (such as names or affiliations). Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, \emph{e.g.},
\begin{quote}
	We previously showed \citep{Gusfield:97} \ldots
\end{quote}
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as 
\begin{quote}
	\citet{Gusfield:97} previously showed\ldots
\end{quote}
Please do not use anonymous citations and do not include acknowledgements.
\textbf{Papers that do not conform to these requirements may be rejected without review.}

Any preliminary non-archival versions of submitted papers should be listed in the submission form but not in the review version of the paper.
Reviewers are generally aware that authors may present preliminary versions of their work in other venues, but will not be provided the list of previous presentations from the submission form.

Once a paper has been accepted to the conference, the camera-ready version of the paper should include the author's names and affiliations, and is allowed to use self-references.

\paragraph{\LaTeX-specific details:}
For an anonymized submission, ensure that {\small\verb|\aclfinalcopy|} at the top of this document is commented out, and that you have filled in the paper ID number (assigned during the submission process on softconf) where {\small\verb|***|} appears in the {\small\verb|\def\aclpaperid{***}|} definition at the top of this document.
For a camera-ready submission, ensure that {\small\verb|\aclfinalcopy|} at the top of this document is not commented out.


\section{Multiple Submission Policy}
Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time in the START submission form, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted by EACL 2021. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at EACL 2021 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented. We will not accept for publication or presentation the papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.

Authors submitting more than one paper to EACL 2021 must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly ($>25\%$) with each other in content or results.
