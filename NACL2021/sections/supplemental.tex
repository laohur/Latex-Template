\paragraph{Notable changes} in the templates \url{https://2021.naacl.org/calls/style-and-formatting/} (by Matt Post and David Chiang) are:

NAACL-HLT 2021 is using latex templates based on the new organization of templates and formatting guidelines for *ACL papers here\url{https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB}.

We now use the “lineno” package instead of writing pseudo-numbers down the margins. Line numbers now line up, and many other simplifications were enabled by this change.

We will not use the \verb|\aclfinalcopy| command. Instead, the review copy (anonymized, page and line numbers) is enabled by passing “review” as an “acl” package argument:

\begin{verbatim}
    \usepackage[review]{acl}
\end{verbatim}

There is no \verb|\aclpaperid| macro. Softconf will add the submission ID stamp.

A few bug fixes that have cropped up over the years and then sometimes inadvertently reintroduced.
